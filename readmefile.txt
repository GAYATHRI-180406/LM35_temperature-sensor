 Here's the Arduino code to interface an LM35 temperature sensor with Arduino Uno and control the onboard LED based on temperature readings, without using millis(), delay(), or micros() functions:

*Explanation:*

1. *Include Library:* We include the TimerOne library, which allows for generating interrupts at specific intervals without using delay().
2. *Define Pins:* We define sensorPin for the LM35 and ledPin for the onboard LED.
3. *Global Variables:* We declare temperature to store the measured temperature and blinkInterval to hold the current blinking interval.
4. *Setup:*
   - pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT): Sets the LED pin as output.
   - Timer1.initialize(250): Initializes Timer1 with an initial period of 250 microseconds.
   - Timer1.attachInterrupt(blinkLED): Attaches an interrupt to Timer1, which will trigger the blinkLED function every time the timer overflows.
   - Timer1.start(): Starts Timer1.
5. *Loop:*
   - voltage = analogRead(sensorPin) * 5.0 / 1023.0: Reads the voltage from the sensor and converts it to a voltage value between 0 and 5 volts.
   - temperature = (voltage - 0.5) * 100: Converts the voltage to temperature (°C) using the LM35's calibration factor (10mV/°C).
   - *Conditional Statement:* Based on the temperature:
     - If temperature is below 30°C, set blinkInterval to 250 (faster blink).
     - Otherwise, set blinkInterval to 500 (slower blink).
6. *blinkLED function:*
   - digitalWrite(ledPin, !digitalRead(ledPin)): Toggles the LED state.
   - Timer1.write(blinkInterval): Updates Timer1's period with the new blinkInterval value, defining the next blink timing.

*Advantages:*

- This code avoids using delay(), which can block the program execution, making it more efficient and responsive.
- It leverages the TimerOne library for accurate timing and allows the program to continue processing other tasks while blinking the LED
